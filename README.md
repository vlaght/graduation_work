# noise with GOST

This is a clone of Go package that implements the [Noise Protocol
Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org). See [the
documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/flynn/noise) for usage information. In this fork Noise protocol uses ciphersuits based on Russian GOST cryptographic primitives (ГОСТ Р 34.12-2015 with GCM mode and ГОСТ Р 34.11-2012 with 256 and 512 hash length).

TODO:
 - build VPN-tunnel based on this Noise protocol implementation
